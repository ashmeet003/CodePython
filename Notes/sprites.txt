***********************************************PyGame***********************************

makes structure and objects of a game easy to use
sprites, collision
screen updates
controls-mouse, keyboard, game controllers
sounds, writing, screen drawing.

---------------------
Sprite is made of twoparts:
one we can see: surface- you can import graphics...save it as png files and import it
-we cannot see- rectangle: hitbox, area of sprite which handles collisions.pygame could make hitbox based on shape of object.
                           controls where sprite moves- its functional part of sprite

Screen.blit(surface, location) # blit says we are putting this image/surface to that location
number of pictures displayed simultaneously, makes us see motion. like a flip book- creating illusion of movement
- while we are looking at one screen, pygame is drawing next screen in memory, next pygame flips to next screen creating movement
Screen.flip() # flips to next screen.

Game Loop:
while true loop till game is on:
    user input
    update sprites
    draw background
    blit sprites/object
    collision check
    flip display
    clock control --- says pause for a moment...so game will not be over even before we move our character
    game over?
