************************    Algorithms     ***************************

Algorithms:
    - a set of instruction
    - helps to solve a problem in systematic order
    - structured approach to problem-solving

To develop an algorithm:
    - understand the problem
    - brak down the problem
    - designing the algorithm
    - implementing the algorithm
    - test debug
    - optimize
    - reassemble
    - documentation
