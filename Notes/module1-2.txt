INTRO to PYTHON:

Python is a high-level language 
    - It provides abstractions and features that make code easier.
    - emphasizes code readability
    - uses significant indentation; meant to have semantic meaning
    - off-side rule for indentation enforces a consistent and readable structure
    - Uses OOP - codes around objects, which are instances of classes containing data(attributes) and behavior(mehtods)
    - This promotes modular and reusable code.
    - It is dynamically types - data types are inferred at run time: makes easier to write data.
    - Has garbage collection: manages memory allocation and deallocation: so no manual memory management.
    - Supports multiple programming paradigms: combine different programming approaches in same codebase
    - = battery included language: cause comes with standard library.

    - It is slower than c/c++(low level language) because it is interpreted language
        It's compiler is a interpreter which interpret english language to machine language and then outputs to screen
        Hence, needs more computing power

- created in 1980's by Guido van Rossum

BASICS:

Variable: 
    a named container for some data
    A variable in Python is an object or class
    can only start/include with letter or '_'
    are case sensitive
        name = "John"
        print(name)
    stores: numbers, strings, lists, and dictionaries, functions, objects.

Data Types:
    str: ""
    int: 1
    float: 12.33
    bool: True, False # CAPITAL T/F; 0 = False
    List Types
    None

Functions:
    type(): returns type of specified object
        dataType = type("name")
    input(): allows user to input a value
        input("Your age?: ) #input is always a string

String Methods:
    str.isalnum()
    str.isalpha()
    str.isdecimal()
    str.isdigit()
    str.islower()
    str.isupper()
    str.isnumeric()
    str.ascii()
    str.isidentifier()
    str.isprintable()
    str.isspace()
    str.istitle()
     
    str.strip() #remove extra spaces
    str.lower()
    str.upper()
    str.swapcase() #makes upper to lower and vice versa
    str.replace()
    find()

String format method:
    -insert variable to string
    - format string
        txt = "My name is {}, I'm {}".format{"John",36}
        txt1 = "For only {price: .2f} dollars"
        print(txt1.format{price = 49})
    - 3 ways to input placeholders:
        {},{}:      empty
        {0}, {1}:   indexed
        {strname}:  Named

F string:
    - prepend string with f 
    - sub the value through variable
        strName = "John Doe"
        print(f"Hello, {strName}!")
