****************    Python Modules  ***************************

-A module file contains functions, classes, and Variables.
- a regular .py file which can be imported in other files too.

functions/variables in imported module needs to called using dot operator

import myModule
myModule.greet()
myModule.x

- 'from' keyword could be used to import specific functionality from the code module
    Through this method=> dot is not needed
    However, if same name is used elsewhere in the code, namesapce conflict could occur

    from myModule import greet, x
    greet()
    print(x)

- '_name_' keyword stores name for imported module.
    During codes execution this _name_ chages to _main_

    from my_module import greet, PI

    greet("Bob")
    print(PI)# my_module.py
    def greet(name):
       print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    if __name__ == "__main__":
       # This code will only run when the module is executed as the main program
       greet("Alice")

*********
Be cautious of namespace conflict
NameError if you forgot to import module but still using its functions
import errors could occur in case of Circular Dependencies
    - which occurs due to two or more modules depend on each other
