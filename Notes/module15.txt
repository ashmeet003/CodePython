******************* Inheritance ****************************
- subclass inherits from super class
- gains access to attributes and methods
- code reusability
- Modularity
- Abstraction - 
    class SuperClass:
    class SubClass(SuperClass):

Polymorphism: overriding existing function
    - especially useful when you want to create generic 
    Method overriding
    duck Typing: a function choosing to behave for certain object depending on type of object passed to it.

    class Bike:
        def drive(self):
            print("Bike is riding.")
    def make_vehicle_drive(vehicle):
       vehicle.drive() # function chooses its object's function
    make_vehicle_drive(bike) # passes bike object to function
